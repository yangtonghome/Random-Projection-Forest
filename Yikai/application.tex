\section{Application}
In this section we describe how to use the \texttt{sparse similarity} or \texttt{dense similarity} generated by RP forest for unsupervised clustering.
\texttt {Similarity} can be seen as the affinity weight, the kernel function between samples, or simply deformed into the distance of the samples in the feature space. We intro tree specific applications of similarity, namely spectral clustering, kernel K-means and density clustering.
